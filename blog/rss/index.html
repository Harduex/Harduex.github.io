The warm-up is divided into <strong>two main parts</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>15 - 30 minutes cardio</strong></li></ul><p>The first thing I begin with is 30 minutes <strong>treadmill walking</strong> on max Incline (<strong>15%</strong>) and speed <strong>4.5 - 5 km/h</strong>.

Feel free to tweak the speed and incline as you like, just remember to increase it gradually every time you work out, so you can become stronger. The <strong>last 5 minutes </strong>we start decreasing the tempo and incline gradually, every minute with little amount, or we just hit the cooldown button of the treadmill, and it should do it by itself.</p><ul><li><strong>5 minutes full-body warm-up</strong></li></ul><p>After the cardio, we will be already warmed up, so we do a quick <strong>5 minutes</strong> full-body warm up which we can choose by yourself. I suggest you to start with this video guide below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzNBx_B4pQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="DO THIS Before Every Workout (5 MIN Warm Up)"></iframe></figure><h3 id="rest">Rest</h3><p>Ideally, rest can be extended from 1 to 3 minutes between supersets.

What should be your Heart Rate during exercise?"><p>Are you pushing yourself too hard when you exercise? If you are looking to get more involved in a cardio exercise routine, knowing your maximum heart rate is a key tool in deciding how vigorous your exercises should be. It will also help you to track how effective your workouts are!</p><h3 id="moderate-exercises">Moderate exercises</h3><p><strong>Moderate exercises</strong> are a great way to improve your fitness level and heart health, especially if you have underlying conditions that make fitness a challenging task for you. If you are engaging in moderate cardio, your breathing should be faster paced than normal, but not uncomfortable. You should not be sweating intensely during exercises like these. For example, this type of exercise can be compared to a briskly paced walk. Other examples of moderate paced exercises include: water aerobics, slow biking, and leisurely swimming.</p><h3 id="vigorous-exercises">Vigorous exercises</h3><p><strong>A vigorous exercise</strong> is a lot more intense than a moderate one. You will notice that during these exercises, you are more out of breath, talking in full sentences will be more difficult, and you will most likely be sweating more. Vigorous exercises can be as simple as speeding up a normal paced walk into a brisk walk, faster paced jogging, or even hopping on a low impact elliptical machine.</p><h3 id="how-to-know-if-im-over-training">How to know if I&apos;m over-training?</h3><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s look at what your target heart rate should be for both of these categories</strong></p><p>Shortly, MHR can be calculated by this formula:</p><blockquote>Maximum Heart rate = 220 - ( your age )</blockquote><p>For example, if you are 50 years old, your<strong> maximum heart rate</strong> would be 220 &#x2013; 50 = 170. Now that you know your maximum heart rate, you can calculate what your <strong>target heart rate</strong> will be for the exercise you are planning to do. </p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.heart.org/">American Heart Association</a> your target heart rate during exercise should be in the range of 50 &#x2013; 85% of your maximum heart rate. For example, if your maximum heart rate is 170, your target heart rate should range from 85 beats per minute to 145 beats per minute during periods of exercise.</p><p>If you are just starting out on your fitness journey, consider beginning with <strong>moderate exercises</strong> and aiming to keep your target heart rate on the lower end of the range. With time your heart will strengthen and be able to reach higher levels as you work out!</p><p>Your heart rate (and exercise intensity) is highly dependent on your fitness goals. When you just starting out on your fitness journey, an intensity of <strong>65 to 75 percent</strong> of maximum heart rate (MHR) is <strong>recommended</strong>. If the goal is to increase overall strength and endurance, aim for<strong> 80 to 85 percent </strong>MHR. Finally, if the goal is to increase work capacity at high levels, work up to <strong>86 to 90 percent</strong> of MHR.</p><h3 id="full-formula"><br>Full formula</h3><p>Use this formula to find your own <strong>HR</strong> preferences:</p><blockquote>220 - age = <strong>MHR</strong><br><strong>MHR</strong> x Training Intensity = Suggested Heart Rate</blockquote><p>Here is an example if you are <strong>23 years old</strong> and your goal is to <strong>increase overall strength and endurance</strong>, aiming for<strong> 80 to 85 percent MHR</strong>:</p><blockquote>220 - 23 = <strong>197</strong><br><strong>197</strong> x 0.80 &#x2248; 158<br><strong>195</strong> x 0.85 &#x2248; 167</blockquote><p>If you want to check more methods for defining your MHR, you can also use a <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/heart-rate-zone">Heart Rate Zone Calculator</a> website.</p><h3 id="stay-healthy">Stay Healthy!</h3>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fish-like autosuggestions in bash shell]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://harduex.com/blog/how-to-install-and-setup-fish-shell-with-default-bash-styles/">previous post</a> I introduced you to <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a>.

Removal of private data from search requests comes in three forms:</p><ol><li>removal of private data from requests going to search services</li><li>not forwarding anything from a third party services through search services (e.g. advertisement)</li><li>removal of private data from requests going to the result pages</li></ol><p>Removing private data means not sending cookies to external search engines and generating a random browser profile for every request. Thus, it does not matter if a public or private instance handles the request, because it is anonymized in both cases. IP addresses will be the IP of the instance. But searx can be configured to use proxy or Tor. <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/morty">Result proxy</a> is supported, too.</p><p>Searx does not serve ads or tracking content unlike most search services. So private data is not forwarded to third parties who might monetize it. Besides protecting users from search services, both referring page and search query are hidden from visited result pages.<br></p><h3 id="its-self-hostable">It&apos;s self hostable!</h3><p>Create a new searx instance just in five minutes using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a></p><pre><code class="language-bash">docker pull searx/searx

For people who live in areas where there are few good walking/running trails, or where the weather is poor, a treadmill can be the best option for this endeavor. Depending on how quickly you go, walking uphill on a treadmill can be as effective as jogging on a flat surface and may also reduce your risk of injury. Using a treadmill to workout instead of running or walking outside actually reduces the risk of injury to the knees and hips because increasing the treadmill&#x2019;s incline increases the intensity level without increasing stress on the body&#x2019;s joints. </p><h3 id="calorie-comparisons">Calorie Comparisons</h3><p>A average <strong>80 kg</strong> person running for <strong>20 minutes</strong> with speed <strong>10 km/h</strong> on a flat surface will burn approximately <strong>230 calories</strong>. By comparison, the same person walking with speed <strong>4.5 km/h</strong> for <strong>20 minutes, </strong>at a <strong>15% incline</strong> will burn <strong>260 calories</strong>. Interestingly, running speed only slightly affects calories burned, so if you are running and trying to burn more calories, running a longer distance is more important than running faster.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-uphill-or-incline-walking">Benefits Of Uphill Or Incline Walking:</h3><ul><li>Strengthen the cardiovascular system.</li><li>Its a lot easy on the body, it won&#x2019;t exert a lot of pressure on your joints.</li><li>It&#x2019;s a lot easy to be followed by overweight and obese people.</li><li>You can walk for longer period of time.</li><li>It won&#x2019;t make you lose your hard-earned muscle mass.

Deciding which form of exercise is best for you ultimately depends on your <strong>body type</strong>, <strong>health</strong> and <strong>overall goals</strong>. Those who are heavier or beginning to exercise may find walking to be an easier way to start working out while building up to more intense exercise. Those with certain injuries or health conditions may also find the low-impact nature of walking more suited to their exercise needs. However, it depends on you to choose what fits you better!</p><h3 id="keep-walking">Keep walking!</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://i.gifer.com/origin/07/077e1d42d3b4cd4901257faa137b2e8c.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why walking on treadmill on full incline is better than running" loading="lazy"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[15 must-have Visual Studio Code extensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>List of the best visual studio code extensions that every developer should try</p><h3 id="1-better-comments">1. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments">Better Comments</a></h3><p>Improve your code commenting by annotating with alert, informational, TODOs, and more!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://github.com/aaron-bond/better-comments/raw/HEAD/images/better-comments.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Annotated code" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.</p><h3 id="2-docker">2. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker">Docker</a></h3><p>Makes it easy to create, manage,</p>]]></description><link>https://harduex.com/blog/15-must-have-visual-studio-code-extensions/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">631a3f366d056f00019c5f14</guid><category><![CDATA[programming]]></category><category><![CDATA[backend]]></category><category><![CDATA[frontend]]></category><category><![CDATA[extensions]]></category><category><![CDATA[tips]]></category><category><![CDATA[tricks]]></category><category><![CDATA[web]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[🌿 𝖘𝖎𝖒𝖊𝖔𝖓 🌿]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 13:46:17 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607799131608-9a22dd60e25e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwfHx2aXN1YWwlMjBzdHVkaW8lMjBjb2RlfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2MjkyOTg5MQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607799131608-9a22dd60e25e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEwfHx2aXN1YWwlMjBzdHVkaW8lMjBjb2RlfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2MjkyOTg5MQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="15 must-have Visual Studio Code extensions"><p>List of the best visual studio code extensions that every developer should try</p><h3 id="1-better-comments">1. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments">Better Comments</a></h3><p>Improve your code commenting by annotating with alert, informational, TODOs, and more!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://github.com/aaron-bond/better-comments/raw/HEAD/images/better-comments.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="15 must-have Visual Studio Code extensions" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.</p><h3 id="2-docker">2. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker">Docker</a></h3><p>Makes it easy to create, manage, and debug containerized applications.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/HEAD/resources/readme/overview.gif" class="kg-image" alt="15 must-have Visual Studio Code extensions" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code.

Let&apos;s help you decide which to use.</p><h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-resistance-bands-and-weights">What&apos;s the difference between resistance bands and weights?</h2><p>First, what&#x2019;s the difference in strength training with resistance bands versus weights? </p><p>If you grab a 15-pound dumbbell, the resistance of that 15 pounds stays consistent throughout the entire contraction, that&#x2019;s known as an isotonic contraction. And then there&apos;s isokinetic, which is what we get from the resistance bands, and that&apos;s where the resistance changes as you move. When you grab that resistance band to do a bicep curl towards yourself, that resistance is going to get harder on the top and easier as you bring your hand back down. The more we are going through the motion, the resistance actually changes. So it just strengthens the muscles a little bit differently.</p><p></p><h2 id="benefits-of-resistance-bands">Benefits of Resistance Bands</h2><p><strong>1. You can take them everywhere you go</strong></p><p>Bands are portable and take up virtually no space. They can stow away in a bag, drawer or closet. They pack easily for travel and you can use them anywhere.</p><p>Basically, you have a whole fitness in your bag. You can use bands for most movements that you usually perform with free weights, including squats, lateral raises, rows, triceps extensions and biceps curls.</p><p><strong>2. They Can Build Strength</strong></p><p>Various bands come in different levels of resistance. Power resistance bands are extremely effective for athletic training due to the increased load, variable resistance, and instability. </p><p>Research also shows that using bands with weights improves neuromuscular performance and strength more than weight training alone. These bands can also be used for speed and agility drills for various athletic purposes.</p><p><strong>3. More mobility</strong></p><p>Any type of tube or flat band is great for both post-workout stretches, as well as pre-workout mobility work. Typically, you are limited during stretches by your level of flexibility and range of motion, and many effective stretches even require another person to provide pressure to the muscle. </p><p>Instead, you can use bands to assist with stretching to extend your reach and provide pressure, such as with lying down hamstring stretches. Power bands are also excellent for mobility work when wrapped around sturdy object, such as improving ankle and hip mobility for squats.</p><p></p><h2 id="personal-choice">Personal choice</h2><p>For me, calisthenics, combined with resistance bands are the best choice for building lean muscles, gaining strength and bringing more mobility. Bands can be used not only as better weights, but also as contra weight, helping you to get used to do pull ups, dips or other exercises as you begining your trainign journey.</p><p>Keep pulling &#x1F4AA;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://harduex.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/giphy.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why resistance bands are better than weights" loading="lazy" width="500" height="333"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[6 pack abs in 6 weeks with Weider training program]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p></p><h1 id="weider-6-pack-training">WEIDER 6 PACK TRAINING</h1><p>Weider 6 pack Program is perfect for building strong core and real abs with 6 simple exercises.</p><p>This easy training programm has many advantages.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>It&apos;s perfect for beginners and for experts</strong></strong> &#x2013; exercises are easy and begin with the basic level, so every beginner</li></ol>]]></description><link>https://harduex.com/blog/6-pack-abs-in-6-weeks-with-weider-training-program/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">631a38186d056f00019c5e88</guid><category><![CDATA[Workout]]></category><category><![CDATA[gym]]></category><category><![CDATA[training]]></category><category><![CDATA[energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[power]]></category><category><![CDATA[gains]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[🌿 𝖘𝖎𝖒𝖊𝖔𝖓 🌿]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 19:12:55 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577221084712-45b0445d2b00?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fDYlMjBwYWNrfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2MjY2Mzk1MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577221084712-45b0445d2b00?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fDYlMjBwYWNrfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2MjY2Mzk1MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="6 pack abs in 6 weeks with Weider training program"><p></p><h1 id="weider-6-pack-training">WEIDER 6 PACK TRAINING</h1><p>Weider 6 pack Program is perfect for building strong core and real abs with 6 simple exercises.</p><p>This easy training programm has many advantages.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>It&apos;s perfect for beginners and for experts</strong></strong> &#x2013; exercises are easy and begin with the basic level, so every beginner can use them but they get more complicated pretty fast so advanced sportsmen can also be interested in them.</li><li><strong><strong>It helps not only carve your muscles but also burn fat</strong></strong> &#x2013; during the exercise you not only use your abdominal rectus but you also move your legs and arms.

Dr. J. A. Zahm, C.S.C, Ph.D.</p><p><strong>Yerba mate</strong> is one of the most useful types of tea that is little known. It is prepared from the leaves of a tree species that grows in the tropical forests of South America. It has a strong energizing effect and can replace coffee in the morning as a healthy alternative.</p><p>Yerba Mate has a particularly strong, earthy and actually very complex flavor that can hardly be compared to other types of tea. It is popular in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina. It is a source of valuable and powerful antioxidants, B vitamins, vitamin C, zinc, potassium, manganese.</p><p><strong>Why is yerba mate tea so beneficial?</strong></p><p>Gives a lot of energy and tastes great!</p><p>Yerba mate is a healthy start to the day. It gives just as much energy as coffee, but is a healthier alternative. Yerba mate also contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a>, notably less than the amount in coffee, but after consuming yerba mate, the effects of caffeine are not the same as with a cup of coffee. This is because of the amount of fiber and antioxidants in this tea, which help prevent caffeine from causing such a sudden impact on the nervous system.</p><p>Thanks to the unique combination of active ingredients, Yerba Mate has the ability to simultaneously stimulate and relax the body and clarify the mind. Of the six most common stimulants: guarana, coffee, cocoa, cola and tea, it is characterized by the most balanced, toning and nourishing action. Compared to coffee, Mate is distinguished by a delicate and significantly longer-lasting effect that lasts throughout the day.</p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vA6HIKYkxaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="How To Prepare Yerba Mate"></iframe></figure><p></p><h3 id="how-to-prepare-it-and-everything-you-need-to-start">How to Prepare it and Everything You Need to Start</h3><p></p><p><strong>Preparation of water for Mate</strong></p><p>I recommend using good, low mineralized spring water. Most mineral waters have a high mineralization, respectively a specific added taste from the contained ingredients. If you have the opportunity to prepare Mate with spring mountain water, there is no better approach than this. Tap water is not preferable due to the high content of heavy metals (chlorine, fluorine, etc.). Water with such a content poured into the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calabaza#:~:text=Definition%20of%20calabaza,West%20Indies%20and%20tropical%20America">calabaza</a> &quot;kills&quot; Mate and neutralizes its beneficial qualities and ingredients.</p><p>Regardless of what and how you preheat, it should be kept in mind that the appropriate water temperature is between 60&#xB0; and 80&#xB0;. The lower one would not be able to sufficiently reveal the strength and potential of Mate, and the warmer one will burn it with the first pour. Different Mate brands tolerate different temperatures as well. Your personal preferences also matter, some materos prefer a cooler Mate, similar in temperature even to terrere, while others drink it almost hot. Experiment and find your temperature and Mate experience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Fill the calabaza with yerba mate about &#xBD; to &#xBE; of its volume. The smaller fractions (gaucho) fill about &#xBD;, while the classic Argentine and even Paraguayan with sprigs, about &#x2154; or &#xBE;. The idea is that the leaf-only fractions swell more after being poured, unlike those with twig content. The knowledge of exactly how much yerba mate to fill the gourd with will crystallize over time, as mate experience is gained.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Cover with the palm of your hand and turn the calabaza upside down. We intensively shake the full calabaza up and down vertically.</p><p><strong>The goal is</strong>: </p><ul><li>To create a space to place the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombilla">bombilla</a>.</li><li>Mate to be structured as a natural filter, separating the smaller and powdery fractions to the lower palm (towards the throat). In this way, returning the calabaza to it&apos;s starting position, the larger particles remain on its underside (the bottom), preventing the subsequent clogging of the bombilla;</li><li>Through the palms, to feel the rhythm of the yerba in the body.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: We return the calabaza to the starting position (with the neck up), simultaneously building Mate at a 45&#xB0; slope to the axis of the calabaza and creating the so-called Mate mountain. The space opposite it, &#xBC; to &#xBD; of the volume of the calabaza, we leave empty, in it we will pour the water for Mate. During this preparation, as well as during the subsequent infusions, it is important to preserve the structure of the Mate mountain;</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Pour water at room temperature on the wall opposite to Mate Mountain until &#x2153; to &#x2154; of the free volume is occupied. </p><p><strong>The idea is</strong>:</p><ul><li>Do not &quot;burn&quot; and scald the yerba already with the first watering, in case we pour directly with the warm water;</li><li>To preserve all the nutritional and beneficial ingredients, preventing at the same time the excessive release of tannins;</li><li>To prepare and gradually temper Mate.</li></ul><p>We wait 1-2 minutes for the room temperature water to be absorbed and top up with the previously prepared 60&#xB0; - 80&#xB0; water. We fill so that the yerba with the water occupies about &#x2158; or &#x215A; of the volume of the calabaza. We run the water down the calabaza wall, not directly onto the foliage, so that it seeps into the yerba from the bottom up.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: We place the bombilla perpendicular to the Mate mountain, pre-blocking its tip with a thumb, preventing it from clogging and entering air. The best, from the point of view of preserving the structure of Mate and filtering it, is the bombilla to be &quot;punched&quot; under the Mate mountain, starting from the opposite wall.
