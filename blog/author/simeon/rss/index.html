This release is a leap forward in real-time image generation, boasting the capability to produce images with only one step. However, it&apos;s essential to note that, as with any cutting-edge technology, there are some limitations.</p><p>The SDXL Turbo model operates as a 512 x 512 square model, which means it may not excel in certain areas such as text, photorealism, or intricate facial details. Nevertheless, it&apos;s crucial to approach this as a research release &#x2013; a glimpse into the future of accelerated AI image processing.</p><p><strong>Getting Started with SDXL Turbo</strong></p><p>Here is example ComfyUI workflow that you can use to get started:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><iframe src="https://comfyworkflows.com/embed/bc6cba35-17b9-41e8-88d3-ace35213c373" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Unlike its predecessor, the SDXL Turbo model doesn&apos;t utilize a negative prompt, streamlining the workflow. To achieve optimal results, I recommend adjusting your CFG to a value of one for a better outcome, preventing images from appearing overexposed. The SDXL Turbo model introduces a new scheduler &#x2013; the SD Turbo scheduler. I suggest to use one to three steps for best results.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It&apos;s evident that Stability AI is pushing the boundaries of AI-generated art. While this release is more of a playground for experimentation than a production tool, it offers a sneak peek into the future of AI image generation.</p><p>While the quality of this model is not the best, I believe its primary role is to serve as the catalyst for a chain reaction, paving the way for more optimized and faster models. This is already evident in the trending models section on <a href="https://civitai.com/">Civit AI</a>, where new and optimized SDXL model versions such as <a href="https://civitai.com/models/112902/dreamshaper-xl?modelVersionId=351306">DreamShaper XL Turbo</a> and <a href="https://civitai.com/models/129666/realities-edge-xl-lightning-turbo">Realities Edge XL LIGHTNING + Turbo</a> are already present! Although they are not based on the original SDXL Turbo model but SDXL, they achieve impressive results with only <strong>6-8</strong> steps needed per decent 1024 x 1024 image generations.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Become a Better Programmer - 5 Tips for Productivity]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking to level up your programming skills and become a better programmer?

There are different types of fasting, but one of the most common is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting">intermittent fasting</a></strong>, where you alternate between periods of eating and fasting.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss the <strong>six stages of fasting</strong> and their amazing benefits. Let&apos;s dive in.</p><h3 id="stage-1-8-14-hours">Stage 1: 8-14 Hours</h3><p>In the first stage of fasting, your <strong>blood sugar starts to stabilize</strong>, and your <strong>body begins to use up the stored sugar called glycogen</strong>. At around the 10th hour, your muscles start to use both glucose and fat for energy, which marks <strong>the beginning of the transition from sugar burning to fat burning</strong>.</p><h3 id="stage-2-14-24-hours">Stage 2: 14-24 Hours</h3><p>During this stage, the <strong>liver starts to turn your fat into ketones</strong>, and your <strong>cravings start to decrease</strong>. You&apos;ll notice an <strong>increase in energy</strong> and <strong>improvements in your mood</strong>, <strong>cognitive function, focus, memory, and concentration</strong>.</p><h3 id="stage-3-24-36-hours">Stage 3: 24-36 Hours</h3><p>This stage is where <strong>you enter a full ketosis state</strong>, and<strong> your body starts to burn fat for energy</strong>. Your <strong>appetite will decrease</strong>, and you&apos;ll experience a drop in <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22804-ghrelin#:~:text=Ghrelin%20is%20a%20hormone%20produced,your%20brain%20you&apos;re%20hungry.">ghrelin hormone</a>, which is why <strong>you&apos;ll feel less hungry</strong>. You&apos;ll also experience a spike in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697050/#:~:text=Brain%2Dderived%20neurotrophic%20factor%20(BDNF,CNS%2C%20gut%20and%20other%20tissues.">brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)</a>, which promotes the <strong>growth of new brain cells</strong>.</p><h3 id="stage-4-36-48-hours">Stage 4: 36-48 Hours</h3><p>At this point, you&apos;ll experience serious <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy#:~:text=What%20is%20autophagy%3F,become%20defective%20or%20stop%20working.">autophagy</a>, a process where <strong>your body recycles old and damaged proteins, microbes, and other waste into new proteins, fuel, and replacement parts</strong>. Autophagy helps <strong>your body become more efficient and repairs any damage that has occurred</strong>. Additionally, <strong>autophagy kills cancer cells and decreases oxidative stress and misfolding proteins</strong>, which can lead to chronic inflammation and diseases like Alzheimer&apos;s.</p><h3 id="stage-5-48-60-hours">Stage 5: 48-60 Hours</h3><p>During this stage, your <strong>insulin sensitivity improves</strong>, and you experience more autophagy, <strong>less inflammation</strong>, and healing from atrophy. Your body is also able to protect your muscles from being used as fuel, and the old, damaged proteins that were recycled in stage four are converted into new proteins to help <strong>heal atrophy</strong>.</p><h3 id="stage-6-60-72-hours">Stage 6: 60-72 Hours</h3><p>In the final stage of fasting, <strong>your immune system experiences regeneration and rejuvenation</strong>. A 72-hour fast has been shown to lead to a near-complete rejuvenation of the immune system, and people undergoing chemotherapy experience less damage. <strong>Your body produces more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223686/#:~:text=%2D%20An%20undifferentiated%20cell%20that%20is,tissue%20from%20which%20it%20originated.&amp;text=%2D%20Any%20substance%2C%20usually%20a%20protein,that%20stimulates%20an%20immune%20response.">undifferentiated immune stem cells</a>, which can help in the production of new immune cells.</strong></p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The <strong>benefits of fasting are incredible</strong>, and these six stages show just how amazing the process can be. Fasting helps your body become <strong>more efficient</strong>, improves cognitive function, decreases inflammation, and promotes longevity. Additionally, fasting can help with <strong>weight loss</strong> and <strong>managing chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease</strong>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Use TypeScript Aliases to Clean Up Your Import Statements]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When working with any technology it is important to maintain your code clean and organized.

In this post, we will go over how to configure and use them to make your code better!</p><h2 id="what-are-typescript-aliases">What are TypeScript Aliases?</h2><p>TypeScript aliases allow you to create a shorter name for a module or file. For example, instead of importing a module using a relative path, you can create an alias and use it instead. This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.</p><h3 id="setting-your-aliases">Setting your aliases</h3><p>To create an alias in TypeScript, you need to define the paths and baseUrl properties in the compilerOptions section in the <code>tsconfig.json</code> file:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;baseUrl&quot;: &quot;./src&quot;,
    &quot;paths&quot;: {
      &quot;@components/*&quot;: [&quot;app/components/*&quot;],
      &quot;@services/*&quot;: [&quot;app/services/*&quot;],
      &quot;@users/*&quot;: [&quot;app/users/*&quot;]
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>In the above code snippet, we have defined three aliases: <code>@components</code>, <code>@services</code>, and <code>@users</code>. The asterisk (<code>*</code>) at the end of each path is a wildcard that allows us to import any file within the specified folder.</p><h3 id="how-to-use-them-in-your-code">How to use them in your code</h3><p>Now that we have defined our aliases, we can use them in our import statements!</p><pre><code class="language-typescript">import { Component } from &quot;@components/Component&quot;;
import { Service } from &quot;@services/Service&quot;;
import { User } from &quot;@users/User&quot;;</code></pre><p>As you can see, our import statements are much cleaner and easier to read. We no longer need to use the relative path (<code>../../../</code>) to import modules.</p><h3 id="using-barrels">Using Barrels</h3><p>Another way to simplify your import statements is by using barrels.</p><p>Barrels are files that re-export multiple modules from a single location. For example, you could create a barrel file named <code>index.ts</code> in the <code>app/components</code> folder with the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-typescript">export { Component1 } from &quot;./Component1&quot;;
export { Component2 } from &quot;./Component2&quot;;
export { Component3 } from &quot;./Component3&quot;;</code></pre><p>Then, you could import all of the components using a single import statement:</p><pre><code class="language-typescript">import { Component1, Component2, Component3 } from &apos;@component&apos;;</code></pre><p>This is especially useful when you have a lot of modules to import from a single folder.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-using-aliases">Benefits of Using Aliases</h3><p>The major benefit of using aliases is that it makes your code more readable and easier to maintain. When you move components around or add new ones, you won&apos;t need to update your import statements. This can save you a lot of time and effort, especially when working on large projects.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>By defining <strong>aliases</strong> and using <strong>barrels</strong>, you can make your code more <strong>organized</strong>, <strong>readable</strong>, and <strong>easier to maintain</strong>. If you haven&apos;t used aliases before, I highly recommend giving them a try in your next TypeScript project.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Create Music with Artificial Intelligence using MIDI]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn to about free and open source tools for creating music with the help of Artificial Intelligence and MIDI]]></description><link>https://harduex.com/blog/how-to-create-music-with-artificial-intelligence-using-midi/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6443b6f28b61800001e053aa</guid><category><![CDATA[music production]]></category><category><![CDATA[music]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI]]></category><category><![CDATA[open source]]></category><category><![CDATA[art]]></category><category><![CDATA[creativity]]></category><category><![CDATA[exploration]]></category><category><![CDATA[plugins]]></category><category><![CDATA[vst]]></category><category><![CDATA[daw]]></category><category><![CDATA[extensions]]></category><category><![CDATA[github]]></category><category><![CDATA[interesting]]></category><category><![CDATA[projects]]></category><category><![CDATA[sound]]></category><category><![CDATA[sound design]]></category><category><![CDATA[tools]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[üåø ùñòùñéùñíùñäùñîùñì üåø]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 17:54:35 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516110833967-0b5716ca1387?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHJvYm90JTIwbXVzaWN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgyMTU5NjAz&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516110833967-0b5716ca1387?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHJvYm90JTIwbXVzaWN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgyMTU5NjAz&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="How to Create Music with Artificial Intelligence using MIDI"><p>The use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) has revolutionized our world, including the music industry, allowing musicians to explore new ways of creating music. There are two known ways to use AI to create music - one is to work with raw audio, and the other is to use the symbolic approach, which involves working with MIDI files.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)</strong> is a language that allows synths and computers to communicate with each other. MIDI is not only a way of sending signals between devices, but also a way of encoding musical information in a structured and universal format. This makes MIDI a language that AI can learn and understand, just like natural languages or programming languages. MIDI files also don&apos;t hog up too much space in your memory, making it easy to train AI networks with them.</p><p>The first approach is to convert raw audio into MIDI. <strong><a href="https://basicpitch.spotify.com/">Basic Pitch</a></strong> is a free audio-to-MIDI converter developed by <strong>Spotify</strong> that can detect pitch bends. It&apos;s a powerful tool for converting raw audio to MIDI. For instance, if you have an audio recording of a John Coltrane gig that features only an upright bass and a piano, you can effortlessly convert this audio into MIDI by uploading the file to Basic Pitch. The tool will convert it to MIDI in no time.</p><p>Once you have the MIDI file, you need to use a <strong>Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) </strong>to load the file on a MIDI track and assign an instrument to it. There are many DAWs on the market, but Ableton Live is a popular choice. With Ableton Live, you can assign any instrument to the MIDI track, and it will play it.</p><p>But what if you want to create music from scratch using AI? <strong><a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/">Magenta Studio</a></strong> is a collection of open-source tools and models built on Magenta, which uses cutting-edge machine learning techniques for music generation. Continuator is one of the tools that uses AI to create new music. It takes a melody as input and generates new melodies based on that input. You can use Continuator to create new melodies, chord progressions, and drum patterns.</p><p>Another exciting tool that allows you to incorporate MIDI into your AI projects is<strong> This MIDI does not exist</strong>. It uses AI to generate new MIDI files based on existing ones. The tool generates a new MIDI file every time you refresh the page, allowing you to explore different variations of the same melody.</p><p>Apart from just MIDI, AI can also help with audio editing and making remixes. <a href="https://www.lalal.ai/"><strong>LALAL.AI</strong></a> is a powerful tool that can extract stems from audio tracks without any loss in quality. You can separate the vocal, instrumental, drums, bass, piano, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and synthesizer tracks from a song. Then you can feed the <strong>Basic Pitch</strong> with some beats that you like and extract MIDI files from them and generate variations using <strong>Magenta Studio</strong> big set of tools!</p><p>Another amazing AI tool for stems extraction is <a href="https://vocalremover.org/"><strong>Vocalremover.org</strong></a>. It&apos;s a free online tool that separates vocals from instrumentals. It uses AI to create karaoke versions of songs and provides two tracks - a karaoke version with no vocals and an acapella version with isolated vocals. With some post audio processing and polishing, you can extact pretty good quality beats and acapellas for your mixes!</p><p>In conclusion, using AI to create music has never been more interesting. With tools like Basic Pitch, Magenta Studio and This MIDI does not exist, you can explore new ways of creating music and push the boundaries of what is possible. So why not give it a try and see where AI can take your music?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chromaticism in Modern Music: How to Create Unique and Mysterious Sounds]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to use chromaticism in your music to add color, expression, and tension to it.

For example, if you&apos;re playing in <strong>A minor</strong>, which has no sharps or flats, you can add notes like <strong>C#</strong>,<strong> D#</strong>,<strong> F#</strong>,<strong> G#</strong>,<strong> or A#</strong>. These notes create <strong>contrast</strong> and <strong>tension</strong> with the notes in the key.</p><p>Chromaticism can add <strong>color</strong> and <strong>expression</strong> to your melodies and harmonies. You can use chromatic notes to create passing tones, neighbor tones, suspensions, appoggiaturas, or escape tones. These are all types of <strong>non-harmonic tones</strong>, which means they don&apos;t belong to the chord that is playing at the moment. They create a s<strong>ense of movement and resolution</strong> when they resolve to a harmonic tone.</p><p>Chromaticism can also help you change keys or modes. You can use chromatic notes as pivot points or common tones between two keys or modes. For example, if you&apos;re in <strong>A minor</strong> and you want to switch to <strong>C major</strong>, you can use <strong>C# </strong>as a pivot point. You can play a chord progression like <strong>Am </strong>- <strong>Dm </strong>- <strong>E</strong> - <strong>A</strong> - <strong>C#dim</strong> -<strong> F</strong> - <strong>G</strong> - <strong>C</strong>. The <strong>C#dim </strong>chord is a type of chord that leads to<strong> F</strong>, which is the subdominant of <strong>C major</strong>. By using this chord, you can <strong>transition smoothly</strong> from <strong>A minor</strong> to <strong>C major</strong>.</p><p>You can hear examples of <strong>chromaticism</strong> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music">classical music</a> from composers like <strong>Bach</strong>, <strong>Mozart</strong>, <strong>Beethoven</strong>, and <strong>Chopin</strong>. But, it&apos;s not just for classical music. Chromaticism is also used in modern music to create interesting and unique sounds. Music producers use chromaticism to express their feelings. For example, the intro music for the TV show <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/">Westworld</a></strong> is based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale#:~:text=The%20chromatic%20scale%20is%20a,12%20of%20the%20available%20pitches.">chromatic scale</a> that starts from <strong>A minor</strong> and goes up by half steps until it reaches <strong>A# minor</strong>. The composer <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi">Ramin Djawadi</a></strong>, who also composed the music for<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/"> Game of Thrones</a>, uses &#xA0;<strong>chromaticism</strong> and <strong>dissonance</strong> to <strong>create a sense of mystery, urgency, anticipation, tension and suspense</strong>. His music uses both <strong>orchestral</strong> and <strong>electronic instruments</strong>, and it creates a <strong>contrast</strong> between classical and modern elements, as well as between <strong>organic</strong> and <strong>artificial sounds</strong>.</p><p>The other technique called <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/dissonance-music-explained">dissonance</a> is the use of chords or intervals that sound harsh or unstable. Electronic music producers use dissonance to <strong>create a sense of friction and conflict</strong> in their tracks. For example, they might use dissonant intervals like minor seconds, which are only one half step apart, to create a <strong>jarring effect</strong>.</p><p>In summary, chromaticism and dissonance are useful tools for classic and modern music producers. It is used to add contrast, tension, uniqueness and color to the music tracks. You can use chromaticism to modulate to different keys or modes. Additionally, dissonance can can be used to create a sense of tension and suspense.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uploading Our Consciousness To a Computer.

But Should We?"><p>In the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140379/"><strong>Self/Less</strong></a>, an extremely wealthy man dying from cancer undergoes a radical medical procedure that <strong>transfers his consciousness</strong> into the body of a healthy young man. While this might sound like <strong>pure science fiction</strong>, many experts in the fields of neuroscience and computer science believe that<strong> it&apos;s possible </strong>to transfer human consciousness to a computer. But the question remains, <strong>should we do it?</strong></p><h3 id="lets-start-by-understanding-the-process-of-uploading-consciousness-to-a-computer">Let&apos;s start by understanding the process of uploading consciousness to a computer. </h3><p><strong>First</strong>, we would have to read the source brain to learn how we store memories. Unlike computers, neurons don&apos;t store one bit of information; instead, each neuron can create up to 1,000 connections with those around them. Next, we would have to write to the new brain, which involves biochemically modifying neurons and their connections to other neurons. There are trillions of these synaptic connections in each person&apos;s head, so this process is incredibly complex.</p><p>Assuming we can read and write to brains, we would then have to copy that information. However, the human brain isn&apos;t a finite storage system like a hard drive; there could be a lot of space in there, ranging from a few gigabytes to a few million gigabytes. Copying 2.5 petabytes over a USB 3.0 connection, for example, would take more than 80 days.</p><p><strong>The biggest issue </strong>with uploading consciousness to a computer is accurately mapping the brain. Computer scientists from giant companies, major universities, and world governments have been working on mapping and translating the brain network to a computer network for decades. However, thoughts don&apos;t live on a single neuron, nor are they processed in a single place. Instead, they exist as a patterned network of brain cells picking up and processing information.</p><p>While the technology to upload human consciousness to a computer isn&apos;t quite there yet, it&apos;s only a matter of time until we can learn to emulate a brain in a computer and map consciousness on top of it. The question is..</p><h3 id="should-we">Should we?</h3><p><strong>One argument</strong> for uploading consciousness to a computer is that it could extend human life indefinitely. If we could transfer our consciousness to a computer, we would no longer be limited by the lifespan of our physical bodies. This could allow us to live for hundreds or even thousands of years, which could be incredibly beneficial for scientific research and other fields that require a lot of time.</p><p>However, there are also <strong>a lot of potential downsides</strong> to uploading consciousness to a computer. For one, it&apos;s possible that the resulting &quot;uploaded&quot; consciousness would not be the same as the original consciousness. This could result in a loss of individuality or even identity. Additionally, there could be ethical concerns about creating new life forms in the digital realm.</p><p><strong>Another</strong> potential issue is the impact on society. If only the extremely wealthy could afford to transfer their consciousness to a computer, it could lead to an even greater divide between the rich and the poor. It&apos;s also possible that the creation of digital immortality could lead to a lack of motivation and productivity in society, as people would no longer feel the same sense of urgency to accomplish things in their limited lifespan.</p><p><strong>To summary</strong>, while the technology to upload human consciousness to a computer is <strong>advancing rapidly</strong>, the question of whether we should do it is <strong>complex</strong> and <strong>multifaceted</strong>. While it could offer benefits such as <strong>extending human life</strong> and <strong>advancing scientific research</strong>, there are also many potential <strong>downsides</strong> such as <strong>loss of individuality</strong>, <strong>ethical concerns</strong>, and <strong>negative societal impacts</strong>. Ultimately, the decision of whether to pursue this technology will likely involve a <strong>balance</strong> of <strong>scientific progress</strong>, <strong>ethical considerations</strong>, and <strong>societal implications</strong>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Effortlessly Backup and Restore Your Ubuntu/Debian Systems with apt-clone tool]]></title><description><![CDATA[apt-clone is a simple command-line tool that lets you create state files of all installed packages for your Debian/Ubuntu systems, making it easy to restore on freshly installed systems or into a directory.

In this post, we&apos;ll explore how images are represented as arrays of numerical values, and how these arrays can be used as inputs to neural network models.</p><p>To represent a digital image, computers use a <strong>2D array of pixel values</strong>. Each pixel in the image is represented by a single value, which corresponds to the intensity or color of that pixel. For example, a grayscale image might use a single value to represent the intensity of each pixel, with lower values representing darker pixels and higher values representing lighter pixels. A color image, on the other hand, might use 3 values (one for each color channel: red, green, and blue) to represent the color of each pixel.</p><p>To use an image as input to a neural network model, we need to convert the 2D array of pixel values into a 1D array. This is often done using a process called <strong>flattening</strong>, where the 2D array is &quot;unrolled&quot; into a single, long list of pixel values.</p><p>Once the image has been flattened, it can be fed into the neural network model as a <strong>single input</strong>. The model will then process this input, using its learned patterns and relationships to make predictions or decisions based on the content of the image.</p><p>So, how do neural network models &quot;see&quot; and understand images? Essentially, they learn to recognize <strong>patterns</strong> and <strong>features</strong> in the pixel values, using these patterns to make <strong>predictions</strong> or <strong>decisions</strong>. For example, a model trained to classify images of animals might learn to recognize the <strong>shape</strong> of ears, noses, and paws in order to differentiate between different types of animals.</p><p>In summary, digital images are represented as arrays of pixel values, which can be flattened and used as input to neural network models. These models &quot;see&quot; images by learning to recognize patterns and features in the pixel values, using these patterns to make predictions or decisions.</p><p>I hope this post has provided you with some useful and educational information on how computers &quot;see&quot;.</p><h3 id="see-ya-in-the-next-blog-%F0%9F%91%80">See ya in the next blog! &#x1F440;</h3>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Understand Mathematics With The Help of Programming.

Translated Mathematical Notations to JavaScript Code."><p>As a self-taught programmer, reading academic papers can be intimidating. However, understanding mathematical notation is essential for many fields, including computer science. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve created this guide to help developers to understand mathematics better by translating it and comparing it to JavaScript code.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when working with math notation is that different symbols can mean different things depending on the context and field of study. It&apos;s also important to note that there are several conventions for naming variables, such as using italic lowercase letters for scalars, bold lowercase letters for vectors, and bold uppercase letters for matrices.</p><p>In terms of equalities and inequalities, the equals sign <code>=</code> is used for equality, the <code>&#x2260;</code> symbol is used for inequality, and the <strong><code>&#x2248;</code></strong> symbol is used for approximately equal to. The <code>:=</code> symbol is used for definition, such as defining a variable or function. In JavaScript, we can use the <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code> operators to check for equality and inequality, respectively. We can also use a function like <code>almostEqual</code> to check for approximately equal values.</p><p>When working with square roots and complex numbers, we use the <code>&#x221A;</code> symbol for square roots and the <code>i</code> symbol to represent the imaginary number. In JavaScript, we can use the <code>Math.sqrt</code> function to calculate square roots and represent complex numbers using objects with real and imaginary properties.</p><p>Dot and cross products are commonly used in math, and they can be represented using the <code>&#xB7;</code>, <code>&#xD7;</code>, and <code>&#x2218;</code> symbols. In JavaScript, we can use the dot and cross functions from the <code>gl-vec3</code> library to calculate these products.</p><p>Summation is represented using the <code>&#x3A3;</code> symbol, and products of sequences are represented using the <code>&#x3A0;</code> symbol. These operations can be implemented in JavaScript using loops to iterate over the elements in a sequence and perform the appropriate operation.</p><p>Other commonly used symbols in math include the <code>||</code><strong> </strong>pipes for absolute value, the hat <code>&#xE2;</code> symbol for unit vectors, and the <code>&#x2208;</code> and<strong> </strong><code>&#x2209;</code> symbols for &quot;<strong>element of</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>not an element of</strong>&quot;, respectively. These concepts can be represented in JavaScript using functions or built-in methods like <code>Math.abs</code> and the <code>in</code> operator.</p><p>Functions are a crucial part of math and can be represented using the <code>&#x192;</code> symbol. Piecewise functions, which are functions defined using different formulas for different ranges of input, can be represented using the &quot;<strong>piecewise</strong>&quot; keyword. In JavaScript, we can use <strong>functions</strong> to represent these concepts and use <strong>conditional statements </strong>to handle different ranges of input.</p><p>There are many common functions used in math, such as <strong>trigonometric functions</strong> and <strong>logarithmic functions</strong>, which can be represented using JavaScript&apos;s built-in <strong>Math object</strong>. Function notation can also be represented using the <code>&#x21A6;</code> and <code>&#x2192;</code> symbols, and derivatives can be represented using the prime <strong><code>&#x2032;</code></strong> symbol. These concepts can be implemented in JavaScript using functions and the derivative function.</p><p>Other commonly used symbols in math include the <code>&#x230A;</code> and <code>&#x2309;</code><strong> </strong>symbols for floor and ceiling, respectively, and various arrow symbols for different types of implications and equalities. These concepts can be represented in JavaScript using the <code>Math.floor</code> and <code>Math.ceil</code> functions and conditional statements.</p><h3 id="to-give-you-a-better-idea-of-how-math-notation-can-be-translated-into-javascript-code-lets-look-at-some-specific-examples">To give you a better idea of how math notation can be translated into JavaScript code, let&apos;s look at some specific examples</h3><p>One common math concept is the dot product of two vectors. In math notation, the dot product is represented using the <code>&#xB7;</code> symbol, like so:</p><p><strong>a &#xB7; b = c</strong></p><p>In JavaScript, we can use the dot function from the <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gl-vec3">gl-vec3</a> </strong>library to calculate the dot product of two vectors:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const vec3 = require(&apos;gl-vec3&apos;); 

const a = [1, 2, 3]; 
const b = [4, 5, 6]; 
const c = vec3.dot(a, b); 

console.log(c); // Outputs 32</code></pre><p>Another common math concept is the cross product of two vectors. In math notation, the cross product is represented using the <code>&#xD7;</code> symbol, like so:</p><p><strong>a &#xD7; b = c</strong></p><p>In JavaScript, we can use the cross function from the <code>gl-vec3</code> library to calculate the cross product of two vectors:</p><pre><code>const vec3 = require(&apos;gl-vec3&apos;);

const a = [1, 2, 3]; 
const b = [4, 5, 6]; 
const c = vec3.cross(a, b); 

console.log(c); // Outputs [-3, 6, -3]</code></pre><p>Summation is another common operation in math, and it is represented using the &#x3A3; symbol. In JavaScript, we can use a loop to iterate over the elements in a sequence and perform the summation operation:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

for (const element of sequence) {
  sum += element;
}

console.log(sum); // Outputs 15</code></pre><p>The absolute value of a number is represented using the <code>||</code> pipes symbol in math. In JavaScript, we can use the <strong>Math.abs</strong> function to calculate the absolute value of a number:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const number = -5;
const absoluteValue = Math.abs(number);

console.log(absoluteValue); // Outputs 5</code></pre><p>These are just a few examples of how math notation can be translated into JavaScript code. By using programming as a different point of view to understand math, we can see how math concepts are applied in a more concrete way and test out different scenarios to see how they affect the result.</p><p>Here is a great Github Repository<strong> </strong>called <strong><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">math-as-code</a></strong> which is a big <strong>cheat-sheet</strong> for mathematical notation in code form with a plenty of examples!</p><h3 id="happy-calculating">Happy Calculating!</h3>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is the /etc/hosts file?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The /etc/hosts file is simply a plain text system file that allows you to map hostnames to IP addresses on your computer.

It can be especially useful when you&apos;re working on a website or server and need to test it on your local machine before it goes live, or when you want to access a specific server within your network by its hostname rather than its IP address.</p><p>To create or edit the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file on a Linux, Unix, or MacOS system, you will need to use a text editor with root privileges.</p><p>For example, to create or edit the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file using the nano editor, you would open the terminal and enter the following command:</p><p><code>sudo nano /etc/hosts</code></p><p>This will open the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file in the nano editor, and you can then make any necessary changes.</p><p>On a Windows system, you can create or edit the <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code> file using a text editor such as Notepad or WordPad. To open the file in Notepad, you will need to run the program as an administrator. To do this, right-click on the Notepad icon and select &quot;Run as administrator&quot; from the context menu.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file is a system file, and making changes to it should be done carefully. It&apos;s a good idea to make a backup of the file before making any changes, and to be sure to follow the correct syntax when adding new entries.</p><p>Here are some examples of how you might use the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p><pre><code># Test a website on your local machine before it goes live
127.0.0.1 example.com

# Access a specific server within your network by it&apos;s hostname
192.168.1.100 fileserver</code></pre><p>In these examples, we&apos;ve created two entries in the /etc/hosts file:</p><ul><li>The first entry maps the hostname &quot;example.com&quot; to the local IP address &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;. This allows you to test the website on your local machine before it goes live.</li><li>The second entry maps the hostname &quot;fileserver&quot; to the IP address &quot;192.168.1.100&quot;. This allows you to access the file server on your network using the hostname &quot;fileserver&quot; instead of the IP address &quot;192.168.1.100&quot;.</li></ul><p>It&apos;s important to note that the /etc/hosts file is used as a backup when a name server is not available. When you are connected to the internet, your computer will typically use a name server to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. However, if the name server is unavailable or if you are working offline, the /etc/hosts file will be used to resolve hostnames. This is why it&apos;s a good idea to keep the /etc/hosts file up to date and accurate.</p><p>In order for the changes you make to the /etc/hosts file to take effect, you will need to restart your network. On a Linux system, this can be done using the command <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart</code>. This will reset the network interfaces and apply the changes you have made to the /etc/hosts file.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breathe Your Way to Better Health: The Wonders of the Wim Hof Method]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to use the Wim Hof Method breathing technique to improve your health and well-being with this simple and effective method.]]></description><link>https://harduex.com/blog/breathe-your-way-to-better-health-the-wonders-of-the-wim-hof-method-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64345eaef1c2e90001d28823</guid><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Breathing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Meditation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mood]]></category><category><![CDATA[Calmness]]></category><category><![CDATA[energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[morning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature]]></category><category><![CDATA[strength]]></category><category><![CDATA[step by step]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[üåø ùñòùñéùñíùñäùñîùñì üåø]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 15:53:18 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://harduex.com/blog/content/images/2022/12/wim-breath-exercise.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://harduex.com/blog/content/images/2022/12/wim-breath-exercise.jpg" alt="Breathe Your Way to Better Health: The Wonders of the Wim Hof Method"><p>Today I will talk about the Wim Hof Method breathing technique, which is a way to use your breath to improve your overall health and well-being.</p><h3 id="why-we-breathe">Why we breathe?</h3><p>Our bodies are constantly using oxygen to produce energy, and the amount of oxygen we inhale through our breathing directly influences the amount of energy that is released into our body cells. On a molecular level, this happens through various chemical and physiological processes.</p><p><strong>Breathing</strong> is an unconscious process that is regulated by our autonomic nervous system, so we don&apos;t have to think about it all the time. However, it&apos;s also something that we can consciously control and influence. In fact, the way we breathe can have a big impact on the chemical and physiological activities in our body.</p><p>This is where the <strong>Wim Hof Method</strong> comes in. Wim Hof is a world-renowned expert on breathing and has developed special breathing exercises that keep his body in optimal condition and give him complete control in even the most extreme situations. His method is based on deep inhaling and exhaling without any force, and he has found that it can have numerous benefits for the body and mind.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering how you can try the Wim Hof Method for yourself. It&apos;s actually very simple and easy to do. All you need to do is <strong>follow these steps</strong>:</p><h3 id="1-get-comfortable">1. Get comfortable</h3><p>Find a comfortable position to sit or lie down in, making sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction.</p><h3 id="2-30-40-deep-breaths">2. 30-40 deep breaths</h3><p>Close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on your breath and try to fully connect with it. Inhale deeply through the nose or mouth, and exhale unforced through the mouth. Repeat this 30 to 40 times in short, powerful bursts. You may experience light-headedness and tingling sensations in your fingers and feet, which are completely harmless.</p><h3 id="3-the-hold">3. The hold</h3><p>After the last exhalation, inhale one final time as deeply as you can, then let the air out and stop breathing. Hold until you feel the urge to breathe again.</p><h3 id="4-recovery-breath">4. Recovery breath</h3><p>When you feel the urge to breathe again, take a big breath to fill your lungs and hold it for about 15 seconds before exhaling. This completes one round of the Wim Hof Method. You can repeat this cycle 3-4 times without taking a break in between.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve finished the breathing exercise, take some time to relax and enjoy the calm state that it brings. This can be a great time to meditate as well.</p><p>If you&apos;re having trouble maintaining a rhythm or pace during your Wim Hof Method breathing sessions, you can use the <strong>Breathing Bubble</strong>, which is an audiovisual guide that helps you stay on track. Simply watch the bubble as it expands and contracts, and follow along with your breath. You&apos;ll hear Wim breathe alongside you, and the background sounds will help you tune out your surroundings and focus on nothing but your breath.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tybOi4hjZFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing"></iframe></figure><p></p><p>I hope you give the <strong>Wim Hof Method</strong> a try and see the benefits for yourself. Remember to always practice in a safe and comfortable environment, and never do it while driving or near water pools. </p><h3 id="happy-breathing">Happy breathing!</h3>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The power of cold showers]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cold showers</strong> have a reputation for being uncomfortable and unpleasant, but they can also have numerous <strong>benefits</strong> for both the <strong>body</strong> and the <strong>mind</strong>.

It uses two main files to manage Docker containers: the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> and the <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>. These files are both important, but they serve different purposes.</p><h3 id="lets-start-with-the-dockerfile">Let&apos;s start with the Dockerfile</h3><p>Think of it as a set of instructions for building a Docker image. A Docker image is like a blueprint for a container, which is an isolated environment that runs your application. You can think of a Dockerfile as a recipe for making a Docker image. It tells Docker what base image to use (e.g., Ubuntu), what dependencies to install (e.g., Apache, PHP), and any additional configuration or setup that needs to be done (e.g., copying files, setting environment variables).</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of a simple Dockerfile:</p><pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y apache2

COPY index.html /var/www/html/

EXPOSE 80

CMD [&quot;/usr/sbin/apache2ctl&quot;, &quot;-D&quot;, &quot;FOREGROUND&quot;]</code></pre><p>This Dockerfile uses the Ubuntu 20.04 base image and installs Apache. It then copies an HTML file (index.html) to the Apache web root directory and exposes port 80. Finally, it starts Apache in the foreground.</p><h3 id="now-lets-talk-about-the-docker-composeyml-file">Now let&apos;s talk about the docker-compose.yml file</h3><p>This file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. A multi-container Docker application is a group of interconnected containers that work together to run a complete application.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of a docker-compose.yml file:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">version: &apos;3&apos;
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - &quot;80:80&quot;
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: my_database</code></pre><p>This docker-compose.yml file defines two services: &quot;web&quot; and &quot;db&quot;. The &quot;web&quot; service uses the Docker image built from the current directory (using the instructions in the Dockerfile) and exposes port 80. The &quot;db&quot; service uses the MySQL 5.7 image and sets some environment variables.</p><p>To summarize, the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> is used to <strong>build a single Docker image</strong>, while the <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong> is used to <strong>define and run multi-container Docker applications</strong>. They are both useful in different ways and can help you take full advantage of Docker&apos;s containerization capabilities.</p><h3 id="keep-the-containers-up-and-running">Keep the containers up and running!</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6AFldi5xJQYIo" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
